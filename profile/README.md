Welcome to the home of the **Flight Simulation Data Link Protocol (FSDLP)** project!

The aim of the project is to bring data link communications such as CPDLC and ACARS into better alignment with the real-world specifications and with modern programming best practices.

We're still in early stages of development and will have our latest version of the specification published very soon!
